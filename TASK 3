🛠 Paytm App – UI/UX Redesign (Concept Project)
🔍 Goal: To redesign the Paytm interface with a cleaner look, enhanced usability, and simplified navigation experience.

✨ What I Improved:
✅ Decluttered Layout – Reduced visual overload for easier focus on key services.
✅ Smart Categorization – Grouped essential services like ticket booking (Flight, Bus, Train, Metro, Event, Movie) in a visually appealing way.
✅ Streamlined Search Bar – Moved prominently to the top for quick access.
✅ Minimalist Approach – Focused on user-friendly spacing, clean icons, and reduced cognitive load.
✅ Responsive & Scalable UI – Designed with responsiveness in mind for consistent experience across devices.

📱 Tool Used: Figma
🎯 Type: Personal learning project (not affiliated with Paytm)
